# About Me

Hello! Welcome to my little website! I am a Computer Science and Business double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University with an interest in programming. I love doing low-level development, but I love to try out new things, especially if those new things are new programming languages or new platforms.

I'm in the midst of creating this website, so please go easy on me, but also let me know if you find any major problems.
